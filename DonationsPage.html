                        Baby turtles are the most affected of all groups as most of them don't even make it to the water.
                        You can help by donating for their cause! Mostly by protecting them until they reach the water.
                    </p>

                    <p>Larger turtles also struggle to survive. The main cause of their problems are actually humans.</p>
                    <p>We can help by collecting all of our rubbish from the<br> seas. Donating will make your funds go directly to water cleaning servies.</p>

                    <p>Sea turtles are omnivores which means they feed on bothanimals and plants . This is good as we can feed them  with our vegetables and fruits.</p>

                <h4>Media</h4>
                <p>
                    There is many ways in which people like you ,can help. The most efficient way is to share our posts on social media, 
                    this includes our Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Those can be found at our <a href="AboutUs.html">about us</a> page.
                </p>
                <h4>Community</h4>
                <p>
                    Another way of helping is talking to your local community of ways that you can help out. If you are underage to donate, 
                    that isn't a problem, talking to your parents can help you reach the goal you wish/strive to achieve. 
                    As a reminder we would like to say that that <b>EVERY</b> bit of help, helps to contribute to the cause. 
                </p>
                <h4>Fundraising</h4>
                <p>
                    A huge help towards this could also be fundraising. Collecting money on our behalf. For our causes. 
                    You can set up a a gofund me page for your local community that is availabe to everyone 
                    right <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/en-ie" target="blank"> here</a>.
