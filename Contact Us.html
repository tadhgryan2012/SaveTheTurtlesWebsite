                        Save the Turtles is an all-volunteer non-profit organisation that has been saving endangered sea 
                        turtles since 2015. We are committed to raising money and spreading awareness of the conditions that 
                        turtles are currently in. One of the things that is most important to us is keeping our supporters 
                        updated on any and all developments made through our organisation on our social platforms. We are the 
                        longest running Irish organisation of our kind and, we believe, one of the most experienced. We are all 
                        passionate about saving this species before it’s too late. This combination of experience and passion 
                        means that we are hardworking and excited to get you involved.

                        We run a tight ship at our main office when it comes to your money. Here is a general break down of where 
                        your money will go. Nearly all funds raised goes to direct protection of sea turtles. Funds are used for 
                        travel when going to many beaches in Ireland and Europe when helping baby turtles to get to sea safely 
                        from predators. Donations are also used to help clean the ocean of waste products and supplying food for 
                        large groups of turtles in specific areas due to the water pollution.
